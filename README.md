# words-qty
This is a simple beginner project that, given a sequence of characters, the program returns all possible words made with them.

## How to use

Run the `run_script.rb`by running it on your terminal
`ruby run_script.rb`

Put the sequence of letters of your choice and then wait for the results :)

You can access the used dictionary [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt).
